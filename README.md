Folder initially was to explore the use of JAX and Mujoco, only to find that the XLA and MJX support isn't there for my system. so the JAX folder has a NN example using the FLAX system, but will probably remain uneddited for now

Currently I'm exploring the use of reinforcement learning and simulation, using gymnasium and mujoco. Current plan is to simulate a drone in mujoco and perform reinforcement learning to have it travel to point and stay there for as long as it can.
